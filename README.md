# WIN32_DoublePendulum_Demo


Demonstration of double pendulum. Because of the presence of spring between two pendulums, its governing equation becomes nonlinear coupled differential equation. Simple Euler method was used to demonstrate the motion of the pendulum.

This demo is built using Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 community version on Windows 10 home.
